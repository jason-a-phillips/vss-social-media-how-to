# How to include VSS social media content in your webpage

## Go to the [Visit San Saba](https://visitsansabatexas.com/single-source/) Social Happenings page.  Click on one of the cards containing a social media post.

> ![VSS Facebook post](img/img1.jpg?raw=true)

## In this example, clicking that link will take you to the post in Facebook.

> ![Facebook post](img/img2.jpg?raw=true)

## Click the menu in the top right corner (three dots). Then click "</> Embed". 

> ![Facebook post](img/img3.jpg?raw=true)

## You will be taken to a page which looks like this:

> ![Facebook code generator](img/img4.jpg?raw=true)

## Click the blue button that says "Get Code"

> ![Facebook get code](img/img5.jpg?raw=true)

## Facebook shows you the JavaScript and HTML that you need to copy into your webpage to embed the post on your website.

> ![Facebook get code](img/img6.jpg?raw=true)

## Copy the code into your website's web page and publish it. I have created an example to show you what that looks like: [facebook-example.html](facebook-example.html)

## That is a simple HTML page which you can use as a template. When I open that HTML page on my laptop in Chrome, this is what I see:

> ![Facebook embedded post](img/img7.jpg?raw=true)

## The Facebook post is embedded in my webpage.
